# Rsbuild project

This is basically a really pared-down Scratch, but for the Logo programming
language. It's very barebones, and I haven't worked on it for very long.

This is really really messy and I don't have a ton of experience with React,
so I prob did a bunch of stuff wrong. It's also pretty buggy, but does work for
the most part. I'm focused on finishing it, not making it perfect.

## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Get started

Start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Build the app for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
pnpm preview
```
